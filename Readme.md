# Nomadium

The project aims to address the common challenge of navigating through
directories containing a large collection of images and videos, enabling users to
efficiently filter and search for their own or others' images.

To achieve this, the solution focuses on two key objectives: face clustering and
texture-based classification. The initial phase of the project implements these
functionalities to simplify and enhance the search process in large datasets.

* *Face Clustering:* This module, developed by Adheesh, categorizes
images based on the faces they contain, grouping similar faces together
to facilitate streamlined browsing.

* *Texture Classification:* A comparison based study of different feature
descriptors with different ML and DL models to find out the best feature
descriptor and what all parameters does the classification depends on.

These components form the foundation of the project's vision to assist in
effectively managing and exploring extensive multimedia collections.

This is a course work project made by Aditya Sinha and Adheesh Trivedi.
